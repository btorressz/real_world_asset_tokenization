🏛 Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) for Inflation Protection

📌 Overview

This Solana-based program allows users to tokenize real world assets (RWAs) such as gold, real estate, art, and corporate bonds as SPL tokens (fractionalized ownership) or NFTs (representing entire assets). It enables staking, yield generation, and liquidity creation for traditionally illiquid assets.

With rising inflation and interest rates, fiat savings are devaluing. This protocol provides an on-chain hedge by tokenizing tangible assets, allowing fractional ownership, staking, and automated yield generation.
