# 🏛 Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) for Inflation Protection

# 📌 Overview

This Solana-based program allows users to tokenize real world assets (RWAs) such as gold, real estate, art, and corporate bonds as SPL tokens (fractionalized ownership) or NFTs (representing entire assets). It enables staking, yield generation, and liquidity creation for traditionally illiquid assets.

With rising inflation and interest rates, fiat savings are devaluing. This protocol provides an on-chain hedge by tokenizing tangible assets, allowing fractional ownership, staking, and automated yield generation.

# 🔥 Features

# 🎟 Tokenization

Create RWAs as SPL tokens with metadata (name, symbol, URI).

Fractionalized Ownership: Assets can be split into multiple tokens for investors.

# 🏦 Staking & Yield

Stake tokenized assets into a program-owned escrow account.

Earn automated yield, calculated based on staking duration.

Unstake and withdraw tokens at any time.

# 🔒 Asset Control

Freeze & Thaw tokens to prevent unauthorized transfers.

Burn tokens for asset redemption.

Update metadata for assets when necessary.

## 📜 Program Architecture (lib.rs)

1️⃣ Initialize a New Tokenized Asset

Creates a new SPL token mint, stores metadata, and mints tokens to the creator’s associated token account.

pub fn initialize_asset(
    ctx: Context<InitializeAsset>,
    asset_name: String,
    symbol: String,
    uri: String,
    decimals: u8,
    total_supply: u64,
) -> Result<()> {

PDAs:

assetAccount: Stores metadata (creator, name, symbol, URI).

mint: The SPL token mint for the asset.

destinationTokenAccount: The user’s associated token account.

📡 Oracle Integration (Future)

Support for Pyth & Switchboard oracles for real-time asset pricing.
