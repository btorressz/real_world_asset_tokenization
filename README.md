# 🏛 Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) for Inflation Protection

# 📌 Overview

This Solana-based program allows users to tokenize real world assets (RWAs) such as gold, real estate, art, and corporate bonds as SPL tokens (fractionalized ownership) or NFTs (representing entire assets). It enables staking, yield generation, and liquidity creation for traditionally illiquid assets.

With rising inflation and interest rates, fiat savings are devaluing. This protocol provides an on-chain hedge by tokenizing tangible assets, allowing fractional ownership, staking, and automated yield generation.

# 🔥 Features

# 🎟 Tokenization

- Create RWAs as SPL tokens with metadata (name, symbol, URI).

- Fractionalized Ownership: Assets can be split into multiple tokens for investors.

# 🏦 Staking & Yield

- Stake tokenized assets into a program-owned escrow account.

- Earn automated yield, calculated based on staking duration.

- Unstake and withdraw tokens at any time.

# 🔒 Asset Control

- Freeze & Thaw tokens to prevent unauthorized transfers.

- Burn tokens for asset redemption.

- Update metadata for assets when necessary.


# 📡 Oracle Integration (Future)

- Support for Pyth & Switchboard oracles for real-time asset pricing.

# 📜 Program Architecture (lib.rs)

**1️⃣ Initialize a New Tokenized Asset**

- Creates a new SPL token mint, stores metadata, and mints tokens to the creator’s associated token account.

**PDAs:**

- ssetAccount: Stores metadata (creator, name, symbol, URI).

- mint: The SPL token mint for the asset.

- destinationTokenAccount: The user’s associated token account.

**2️⃣ Update Asset Metadata**

- Updates the URI of the asset (e.g., pointing to a new metadata location).
- Only the original creator can update metadata.

**3️⃣ Freeze & Thaw Token Accounts**
- Only the freeze authority can execute these actions.

**4️⃣ Burn Tokens (Redemption)**

- Burns SPL tokens to remove them from circulation.

**5️⃣ Stake Tokens (Earn Yield)**

- Users can stake their tokens into an escrow account to earn yield.

**6️⃣ Claim Yield**

- Mints new tokens as yield rewards based on staking duration.

**7️⃣ Unstake Tokens (Withdraw)**

- Users can withdraw their staked tokens from the escrow account.

**8️⃣ Close Staking Account**

- Allows users to close their staking account once they withdraw all staked tokens.

**9️⃣ Transfer Mint Authority**

 Changes the mint authority of an SPL token (e.g., for governance).
